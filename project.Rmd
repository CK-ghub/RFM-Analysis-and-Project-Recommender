## About the dataset
The dataset package provided consists of 6 files containing the details of donations, donors, schools, projects, teachers and resources.

Source: Kaggle

* * *
## Background and Objective
DonorsChoose.org is a US based non-profit organisation founded in the year 2000, that helps public school classroom projects get funded directly by helpful donors. Through charity, they make it easy for anyone to help a classroom in need. The organisation wants to inspire active donors to donate again towards projects they feel strong about. In order to do that, the organisation wants to pair the donors with related classrooms based on their previous donations and interests so that they are motivated to donate again. 

Sometimes there are chances that some projects may not come into light but are desperate for donations. Therefore, we build a recommendation system that recommends categories of projects to teachers across based on previous donations or interests through RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetory value) clustering analysis to group similar types of donors mapped with the respective project category through recommendation.

* * *
## Plans for Review
Review 1: Defining problem statement and reading the dataset followed by basic commands.<br>
Review 2: Exploratory data analysis.<br>
Review 3: To perform clustering based on RFM analysis and recommend project categories.

## How does this analysis help?
Before making recommendations, it would be great to know the right set of donors based on their recent activities, how they actively involve themselves or stay less connected.

Helps find the right set of projects for first time donors. Since we're not usually aware of their preferences yet, its difficult to comprehend their interests right away, leading to a cold start problem. So using the clustering technique can solve such problems.

### Donations dataset

The file contains 4687884 records with 7 variables. They are Project ID, Donation ID, Donor ID, Donation Included Optional Donation, Donation Amount, Donor Cart Sequence, Donation Received Date. <br>

Project ID: Unique identifier of a donor.<br>
Donation ID: Unique ID of a donation.<br>
Donor ID: The donor’s state.<br>
Donation Included Optional Donation: Yes/No to give 15% of donation amount to Donoschoose.org.<br>
Donation Amount: Total amount donated for a project.<br>
Donor Cart Sequence: Project position on list of desired donations within Cart list.<br>
Donation Received Date: Date and time on which the donation was received.<br>

```{r}
#Checking for null values
sum(is.na(df_donations))

<b>No null values present in this dataset.</b>
```{r}

```

```{r}
#Finding number of unique records for all variables
df_donations %>% summarise_all(funs(n_distinct))

<b>We observe that there are 4687844 unique donations, 900K projects and 2M donors.</b>

```{r}
#Distribution of Donation Amount

           median_amount=median(df_donations$Donation.Amount)
           )
```

<b>From the above boxplot and table, the median and mean values, we can see that most of the donations lie in the range of 25-100 USD roughly. Due to the presence of extreme outliers the box plot is flattened. Therefore to visualize the boxplot distribution, we can neglect outliers and filter those donations below 100 USD</b>

## Review 3

## RFM Analysis

* * *

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary. This segmentation technique is used for targeting the most valuable customers based on their recent activities, how often they contribute and the amount spent.<br>
From the above plots, we can see that there a lot of first time donors. Building a recommendation solely based on their activity and frequency for these donors is difficult because we don't really know their preferences yet. This leads to a cold start problem. Therefore by using RFM to cluster the donor we can eliminate this problem to an extent. <br>
After analysis, I'll be fitting clustering models to categorize projects and donors to connect them to the right projects.

## Clustering Analysis

* * *
```{r}
#Standard scaling the data
Scaled_RFM = scale(RFM[,-1])
head(Scaled_RFM)
```

### K Means Clustering

```{r}
Km = kmeans(Scaled_RFM, centers = 4, iter.max = 50)
```

```{r}
clusters <- Km$cluster
RFM.clusters = cbind(RFM, clusters)
```

```{r}
RFM.clusters$clusters <- as.factor(RFM.clusters$clusters)
ggplot(RFM.clusters,
      aes(x = frequency, y = total.donation, colour = clusters, shape = clusters)) +
  geom_point(position = 'jitter') +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Total donation made w.r.t frequency", shape = "cluster", colour = "cluster")
```

```{r}
ggplot(RFM.clusters,
  aes(x = recency, y = total.donation, colour = clusters, shape = clusters)) +
geom_point() +
theme_bw() +
labs(title = "Total donation made w.r.t recency", shape = "cluster", colour = "cluster")
```

```{r}
ggplot(RFM.clusters,

geom_point() +
theme_bw() +
labs(title = "Frequency of donation w.r.t recency", shape = "cluster", colour = "cluster")
```

#### Checking stability of clusters
```{r}
RFM.clusters$clusters <- as.numeric(RFM.clusters$clusters)
clust_no <- 4
library(fpc)
set.seed(1234)
evaluate <- clusterboot(RFM.clusters[,-1], 
                      B=100, bootmethod="boot",
                     clustermethod=kmeansCBI,
                    krange=4, seed=20)
```
```{r}
bootMean_clus <- data.frame(cluster = 1:4, bootMeans = evaluate$bootmean) 
ggplot(bootMean_clus, aes(cluster, bootMeans)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = "darkred", size = 1)) +
 geom_hline(yintercept = c(0.6, 0.8)) +
labs(y = "stability", title = "Stability evaluation") +
theme_bw()+ theme(legend.position="none")
```

<b>Clusters 1,is highly stable with stability factor close to 1. Cluster 2, 3, 4 are moderately stable having a value between 0.6 and 0.8. Overall, the model is stable and hence we can proceed with k=4.</b>

```{r}
evaluate$bootmean
```

<b>Values closer to 1 indicate high stability. </b>

```{r}
#Filtering clusters
cluster1 <- RFM.clusters %>% filter(clusters == '1')

### Inferences from the above plots

(Subject to change with each knit)

<b><u>Cluster 1</u></b>
<b>Donors in cluster 1 donate very frequently and recently. Even though the major project categories are same for all clusters, 
Cluster 1 donors prefer music and arts more than the donors from other clusters. The proportion is almost the same as applied learning.<br>
<b>The top 5 recommended subcategories are :-
<li>Literacy</li>
<li>Language & Writing</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Applied Sciences</li>
<br>
<b><u>Cluster 2</u></b>
Cluster 2 donors are not very recent donors and their total donation is mostly concentrated within 1000 dollars. Their frequency of donation varies from 1-60. Unlike cluster 1 donors, these donors prefer scientific projects over music and arts. They also prefer professional (ESL) and early development more than other clusters.<br>
<b>The top 5 recommended subcategories are :-
<li>Literacy</li>
<li>Language & Writing</li>
<li>Applied Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Environmental Sciences</li>
<br>
<b><u>Cluster 3</u></b>
The Cluster 3 donors are those who donated to a project not very long ago but are not that recent either. Like cluster 1, they also prefer music but on contrary prefer professional (ESL) and early development more than other clusters. This suggests that these donors prefer overall development of an individual.<br>
<b>The top 5 recommended subcategories are :-
<li>Literacy</li>
<li>Language & Writing</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Early Development</li>
<br>
<b><u>Cluster 4</u></b>
Cluster 4 donors don't donate frequently. They donate only once in a long time. Donors in this cluster may prefer Music & Arts over character development. This cluster shows a strong similarity with cluster 2. However, their recency and frequency is in different ranges.<br>
<b>The top 5 recommended subcategories are :-
<li>Literacy</li>
<li>Language & Writing</li>
<li>Applied Sciences</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Environmental Sciences</li>

### Top 10 projects (Project ID) in each cluster based on the number of donations

Although, high number donations needn't lead to high amount.

#### Cluster 2
```{r}
cluster2 %>% group_by(Project.ID)%>%summarize(no.of.donors=n())%>% 
  arrange(desc(no.of.donors)) %>% 
  top_n(10)

#### Cluster 3
```{r}
cluster3 %>% group_by(Project.ID)%>%summarize(no.of.donors=n())%>% 
  arrange(desc(no.of.donors)) %>%
